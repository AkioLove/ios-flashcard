# iOS Flashcard Project

This repository contains design notes for an iOS flashcard application and a small proof-of-concept web version built with Vue.

## Web POC

A simple Vue-based flashcard demo is located in the `web-poc` directory. The entire demo is now contained in a single `index.html` file, which includes the CSS and JavaScript inline. Just open `web-poc/index.html` in a browser to try it out.

## iOS Design

The design document for the original iOS app is available in `DESIGN.md`.
